Dear Team,

All the files uploaded here are programmed by me. And I have written explanation at class level and method level.

Online assessment qualifying application, where the candidates are assessed based on their quality.
The project includes questions generation, question paper generation, delivering the packs to Prime Module,
candidates attend exam, their responses will be saved, scores get generated and with necessary report generation.


This is huge project of 8000 files. I have uploaded only relevant files which I had worked on.
And GitHub is not allowing to upload complete project at one shot.
and it is asking me to upload 100 files at once which is tedious job.
